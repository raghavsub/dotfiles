# dotfiles

My dotfiles for [Manjaro Linux](manjaro.org) with [i3](i3wm.org) and other cool things like [dunst](github.com/dunst-project/dunst), [fzf](github.com/junegunn/fzf), [polybar](github.com/jaagr/polybar), and [streamlink](github.com/streamlink/streamlink).

You can install my dotfiles by running `makesymlinks.sh`.
