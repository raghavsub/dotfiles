# dotfiles

My dotfiles for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) with [i3](https://i3wm.org) and other cool things like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), and [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar).

You can install my dotfiles by running `./makesymlinks.sh`.
