# dotfiles

My dotfiles for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) with [i3](https://i3wm.org) and other cool things like [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar), and [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink).

You can install my dotfiles by running `cd && makesymlinks.sh`
